## Workshop: Learning AnalyticsÂ capacity within your VLE platforms

This page includes two data files, and Python code that generates some analytics from those files. The code is a work in progress.

The two files are:
1. Course_Activity_Obfuscated.csv , and activity file downloaded from Moodle and obfuscated
2. Course_Grades_Obfuscated, a Moodle grade book with two additional grades added: end of term exam grade; and the overall grade for the course. 

AnalyseData.ipynb is written to run in the cloud on Googles colaborative library for AI: https://colab.research.google.com
Running the code will upload selected files to the cloud. Alternatively, you can take the option to run it locally. This requires Anaconda to be installed on your machine.  Anaconda can be downloaded from https://www.anaconda.com/download.
